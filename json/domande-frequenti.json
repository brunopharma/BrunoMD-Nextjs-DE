Fibroblasts are cell types that build fibers and molecular components of the connective tissue, giving the skin its structure and firmness. Activating the fibroblasts encourages the production of new collagen structures as well as the ones from hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid can bind a great deal of water and is indispensable for tight, firmer-looking skin. This process takes some time, but with consistency and determination, your skin regains its natural tone and improves its moisture-storing capacity.</p><p>Royal Collagen Peptides provide the skin with its necessary “building blocks.” Their mode of action is exceptionally sophisticated. They perfectly resemble the fragments which form when skin collagen degrades. Our bodies recognize these peptides as degradation products and boost our collagen synthesis. Thanks to the considerably higher production of natural collagen, the skin can repair itself and replace what was lost through age and environmental influencers.</p></div>"

It gives bones, joints, tendons, ligaments, and muscles strength and flexibility. If the collagenous structures are degraded by heavy stress, like working out, or by the normal aging process, the function of all organs and tissues that depend on collagen are impaired. Ligaments and tendons weaken, muscle mass decreases, and the loss of vital cartilage tissue at the joints can lead to painful symptoms. Fibroblasts are cell types responsible for collagen biosynthesis in the connective tissue. They build fibers and molecular components of the connective tissue, giving the skin structure and firmness.

Collagen makes up the remaining 20% and forms the basic framework of the bone to which calcium “attaches.” Imagine calcium as the concrete bridge and collagen as the steel core. Calcium provides the mineral component of the structure’s strength. For this reason, Royal Collagen Peptides’ consumption is essential for helping maintain bone health. If collagen is missed in your body, the degradation of bone mass along with the stability of high-density bone is compromised. Royal Collagen Peptides help support bone health and improve bone stability and flexibility by stimulating the activity of the osteoblasts, the cell types responsible for the collagen biosynthesis (absorption) in the bone.</p></div>"

Since cartilage is not connected to the bloodstream, it receives its nutrients via synovial fluid that acts like a lubricant film and supplies the sponge-like cartilage with nutrients. This works through movement and pressure. Exercise is essential for providing the cartilage with nutrients. Royal collagen peptides stimulate the activity of the chondrocytes. Chondrocytes are cell types responsible for the collagen biosynthesis in the cartilage. They produce and maintain cartilage matrix.</p></div>"

Furthermore, Royal Collagen Peptides provide the skin with the necessary “building blocks”. Their mode of action is extremely sophisticated. They perfectly resemble the fragments which form when skin collagen degrades. Our body “recognizes” the peptides as degradation products, and boosts the body’s own collagen synthesis.

Astaxanthin is the most potent antioxidant known in nature. Your skin is under constant attack by free radicals, and astaxanthin acts as a defender to preserve collagen production, and lock in the increased elasticity and hydration. A group of 150 healthy women aged 20-55 supplemented with Astaxanthin over six separate studies.* The women taking Astaxanthin demonstrated an 18% improvement in viscoelasticity and 17x increase in skin hydration over the placebo group after just four weeks. Additionally, skin smoothness improved 16%, and age spots were reduced by an average of 3mm in only eight weeks.</p><p>2. Boost collagen production with Specific Collagen Peptides. From highly purified collagen peptides to stimulate fibroblasts, reduce wrinkles, and improve overall skin tone. Bruno MD collagen peptides begin with an organic, non-GMO, halal, and kosher certified bovine source, raised exclusively on a plant-based diet by European partners near the Alps. The EU prohibits ranchers from breeding genetically modified bovines or using GMO feed, unlike farmers in the farmers in the US and Brazil. Three clinical trials* conducted on 250 healthy females, ages 45 to 65, confirm that oral intake of Royal Collagen Specific Peptides Complex significantly reduced eye wrinkle volume by 20.1% on average and up to a maximum of $49.9% vs. the placebo group after only eight weeks of treatment.</p><p>3. Maximize collagen biosynthesis with Red Orange Complex from varieties of Moro, Sanguinello, and Tarocco orange extract to encourage collagen formation and boost the immune system with potent Natural Vitamin C. We harvest our Vitamin C from three varieties of blood orange grown for centuries on family farms near Mt. Etna volcano. This mineral rich soil creates citrus so dense in flavonoids and Vitamin C that the Romans called it “the miracle of Madre Terra”.</p><p>4. Lock in hydration with Hyaluronic Acid. From natural fermentation process which significantly increases skin plumpness, moisture, and glow. Hyaluronic Acid is a sponge that keeps our skin hydrated. Our Hyaluronic Acid is made with organic fermentation and is clinically proven to help reduce wrinkles, smooth skin texture, and deeply hydrate skin cells. A group of 120 healthy women aged 35-60 with dry and sagging skin or wrinkles around their outer canthus supplemented with Bruno MD low molecular weight hyaluronic acid for six weeks and significantly increased skin moisture content and improved the facial aging symptoms such as luster and suppleness.

They quickly respond to foreign cells to fight infection, battle a virus or defend the body against bacteria. Our acquired immunity—also called adaptive immunity—uses T-cells and B-cells when invading organisms slip through that first line. These cells take longer to develop because their behaviors evolve from learned experiences, but they tend to live longer than innate cells. Adaptive immune cells remember foreign invaders after their first encounter and fight them off the next time they enter the body. This is the fundamental premise for how vaccines work—using a small, harmless amount of protein from a disease to allow the immune system to recognize that protein if the pathogen were to invade the body.</p><p>B-cells and T-cells are also called lymphocytes. 'There are primary and secondary lymphoid organs involved in the complex development of lymphocytes,” says Pamela Crilley, DO, Chair of the Department of Medical Oncology at Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA). “The primary lymphoid tissues in the initial generation of B- and T-lymphocytes are the bone marrow and the thymus.”</p><p>B-cells fight bacteria and viruses by making Y-shaped proteins called antibodies, which are specific to each pathogen and are able to lock onto the surface of an invading cell and mark it for destruction by other immune cells. </p></div>"

Killer T-cells directly kill cells that have already been infected by a foreign invader. T-cells also use cytokines as messenger molecules to send chemical instructions to the rest of the immune system to ramp up its response.</p><p>While both are critical to the body's defense against disease and infection, T-cells and B-cells play very different roles.</p></div>"

                        "content": "<div><p>Our body’s ability to fight infection and disease depends on our immune systems. The immune system is comprised of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect your body from illness and infection.</p><p>Since the immune system is not just a single entity, there isn’t a single food that you can eat or add to your diet to support it. The best way to keep your immune system running smoothly is to follow healthy living strategies that include.</p><p>Good Nutrition </p><p>Good nutrition is vital to supporting a healthy immune system. Follow a plant-based, heart-healthy menu that incorporates a variety of vegetables and fruits, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats. Eat small, frequent meals throughout the day to stay energized and ensure your body is getting enough calories, proteins, and nutrients. </p><p>Phytochemicals </p><p>Fruits, vegetables, and other plants contain a naturally occurring compound known as phytochemicals (or phytonutrients). Phytochemicals refer to a variety of compounds that give fruits and vegetables their color and flavor. Studies show that phytochemicals support the:</p><p>Immune system</p><p>Creation of healthy cells</p><p>Death of damaged cells. Phytochemicals also act as antioxidants to protect the body from damage.</p><p>Dietary Supplements </p><p>Dietary supplements help you get adequate amounts of essential nutrients if you don’t eat a nutritious variety of foods or if these nutrients cannot be taken from the food itself. However, make sure to always take dietary supplements that follow the highest standard quality control process. The FDA has established good manufacturing practices (GMPs) that companies must follow to help ensure the identity, purity, strength, and composition of their dietary supplements. These GMPs can prevent adding the wrong ingredient (or too much or too little of the correct ingredient) and reduce the chance of contamination or improper packaging and labeling of a product. The FDA periodically inspects facilities that manufacture supplements.</p><p>Lifestyle </p><p>Change your lifestyle to help support your health and immunity.</p><p>Get Enough Sleep </p><p>Sleep is an essential aspect of health. Our bodies need sleep to recharge and heal. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that adults get seven hours or more of sleep every night. </p><p>Minimize Stress </p><p>Stress can also take a toll on the immune system. In many ways, mental health can also affect your physical health. Try to reduce stress by taking time to do things you enjoy, such as spending time with family, spending time outdoors, or reading. If your feelings of anxiety or depression make it difficult for you to complete daily tasks, talk to your healthcare professional.</p><p>Exercise Regularly </p><p>Leading an active lifestyle can also support your immune system by promoting good circulation, allowing the cells and substances of the immune system to move through the body freely and do their job efficiently. Regular exercise promotes good cardiovascular (heart) health, too. The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) recommends getting at least 150 minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity a week. Physical activity includes walking, jogging, swimming, biking, playing sports, etc. Include strength training and stretching along with aerobic exercise to build muscle and increase flexibility.</p><p>Enjoy Life </p><p>Enjoy family, entertaining old friends, and making new ones; turn the simplest occasion into a social gathering for the entire neighborhood.</p></div>"

Most other products opt to use a cheaper synthetic alternative. The main issue with using this synthetic option is that it has a different molecular profile to natural astaxanthin. While the only clinical study on synthetic astaxanthin indicates it may have some health benefits, little clinical research has been done to measure its effectiveness compared to natural astaxanthin. Some research even suggests that Natural Astaxanthin is 20 to 60 times more potent than its synthetic variant. Very few products on the market today use Natural Astaxanthin extracted from the algae H.
